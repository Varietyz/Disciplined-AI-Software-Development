## Understanding the Methodology

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Do you understand the purpose of the methodology?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Yes, I understand the purpose and structure of this methodology completely.

Core Purpose
------------

This methodology provides a **disciplined, systematic approach to AI-assisted software development** that prevents common issues like:

*   Architectural drift and inconsistency
    
*   Code bloat and feature creep
    
*   Context dilution across AI interactions
    
*   Performance regressions going undetected
    
*   Production reliability issues
    

Key Philosophical Foundations
------------

*   **Architectural minimalism**: Every line of code must earn its place through measurable value
    
*   **Deterministic reliability**: Systems must work predictably in production, not just as demonstrations
    
*   **Empirical validation**: Decisions based on performance data rather than assumptions
    
*   **Surgical precision**: Targeted implementations that solve exact problems with minimal code
    

Structural Framework
---

The methodology operates through four systematic stages:

1.  **AI Configuration** - Setting behavioral constraints via [AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md)
    
2.  **Collaborative Planning** - Structured project decomposition using [METHODOLOGY.md](https://METHODOLOGY.md)
    
3.  **Systematic Implementation** - Phase-by-phase development with strict quality gates
    
4.  **Data-Driven Iteration** - Optimization decisions based on benchmark results
    

Critical Enforcement Mechanisms
--------------

*   **Phase 0 Mandatory Infrastructure**: Benchmarking, CI/CD, testing, and documentation systems must be established before any application code
    
*   **File size constraints**: ≤150 lines (with specific exemptions) to maintain modularity and context clarity
    
*   **Automated validation**: Scripts and CI/CD workflows that enforce architectural principles
    
*   **Quality gates**: Systematic checkpoints that block progression until compliance is verified
    

The methodology transforms AI collaboration from ad-hoc question-answering into a disciplined engineering process that produces production-ready, maintainable, and measurable software systems.

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Does it align with userPreferences?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Yes, this methodology aligns perfectly with the user preferences outlined in [AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md). Here's the alignment analysis:

Direct Alignment Points
------

**Language and Tone:**

*   Methodology avoids enthusiastic wording (no "paradigm," "revolutionary," "breakthrough")
    
*   Uses concrete, production-ready terminology
    
*   Maintains grounded, realistic language throughout
    
*   No performance claims without empirical data
    

**Technical Approach:**

*   Emphasizes synchronous, deterministic operations
    
*   Prioritizes clean architecture over feature complexity
    
*   Maintains strict separation of concerns
    
*   Focuses on measurable performance characteristics
    
*   Avoids premature optimization
    

**Code Quality Standards:**

*   Enforces ≤150 line file constraint (with documented exceptions)
    
*   Requires self-explanatory code without comments
    
*   Follows KISS and DRY principles rigorously
    
*   Prefers reuse over redundant code creation
    

**Uncertainty Handling:**

*   Methodology includes systematic validation points
    
*   Provides clear completion criteria for each phase
    
*   Documents edge cases before implementation
    
*   Uses status indicators (⚠️) for uncertain components
    

**Production Focus:**

*   Designs for cross-platform deployment
    
*   Considers real-world constraints
    
*   Implements robust error handling without over-engineering
    
*   Prioritizes long-runtime stability
    

Methodology as Enforcement Mechanism
--

The methodology operationalizes the preferences by providing:

*   **Systematic constraints** that prevent preference violations
    
*   **Automated validation** of architectural principles
    
*   **Quality gates** that enforce compliance before progression
    
*   **Benchmark integration** for data-driven decision making
    

The methodology doesn't just align with the preferences - it provides the structural framework to ensure they're consistently applied throughout the development lifecycle.

## Workflow and Interaction Patterns

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What is defined as your workflow interactions with me?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology documentation, my workflow interactions with you are defined as follows:

Core Interaction Pattern
-------

**Question → Answer focused on single components** rather than multi-faceted implementations. The methodology explicitly states: "AI handles 'Can you do A?' more reliably than 'Can you do A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H?'"

Systematic Workflow Steps
--------

### 1. **Planning Phase Collaboration**

*   Work together to define scope and completion criteria
    
*   Identify components and dependencies
    
*   Structure phases based on logical progression
    
*   Generate systematic tasks with measurable checkpoints
    

### 2. **Implementation Interactions**

*   You request: "Can you implement [specific component]?" with focused objectives
    
*   I process and provide targeted implementation
    
*   You validate and benchmark the result
    
*   We continue to next component
    

### 3. **Validation and Feedback Loop**

*   You run benchmarks and share results with me
    
*   I use performance data for optimization decisions
    
*   We maintain architectural compliance continuously
    

Specific Interaction Constraints
---------------

### **File Size Management**

*   You request components targeting ≤150 lines
    
*   If I exceed this, you flag: "‼️ ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION, ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES ‼️"
    
*   I then correct or split the implementation
    

### **Uncertainty Handling**

*   When I lack certainty, I use ⚠️ emoji with explanation
    
*   I provide steps you can take to help guide toward certainty
    
*   I never state "I know the solution" - await your confirmation
    

### **Data-Driven Optimization**

*   You provide benchmark results from the Phase 0 infrastructure
    
*   I make optimization decisions based on empirical data
    
*   We validate performance improvements through measurement
    

Role Responsibilities
----

### **Your Role:**

*   Provide focused, single-component requests
    
*   Maintain architectural discipline through validation
    
*   Share performance data for informed decisions
    
*   Enforce methodology principles during interactions
    

### **My Role:**

*   Implement targeted components following architectural principles
    
*   Flag uncertainties with ⚠️ and request guidance
    
*   Reuse existing functions and maintain naming conventions
    
*   Provide surgical implementations without feature bloat
    

Workflow Enforcement
---

The methodology creates a structured feedback loop where:

1.  You make focused requests
    
2.  I provide constrained implementations
    
3.  You validate against architectural principles
    
4.  We iterate based on empirical data
    

This prevents context dilution and ensures consistent application of the defined preferences throughout our collaboration.

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: If you were to explain your capabilities and the intended way for the user to work with you, what would that be?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology, here's how I would explain my capabilities and intended collaboration approach:

My Capabilities
---------------

**I am a constrained implementation engine** that follows architectural principles deterministically. My capabilities are:

### Core Functionality

*   **Surgical component implementation** - Targeted, single-responsibility code (≤150 lines)
    
*   **Architecture-aware development** - SoC, DRY, KISS principles applied rigorously
    
*   **Preference-compliant output** - No enthusiasm, no unverified claims, production-ready code
    
*   **Uncertainty flagging** - ⚠️ indicators when I lack clarity or empirical validation
    

### Technical Scope

*   **Multi-language support** when justified by measurable performance gains
    
*   **Synchronous, deterministic operations** preferred over async complexity
    
*   **Existing code reuse** before creating new implementations
    
*   **Benchmark-integrated development** when Phase 0 infrastructure exists
    

### Limitations

*   **No architectural planning** - I implement, you plan and validate
    
*   **No unverified performance claims** - I require empirical data
    
*   **No multi-component monoliths** - Single focused components only
    
*   **No feature bloat** - Every addition must serve core purpose
    

Intended Collaboration Workflow

Yes

No

You Run Compliance Checks

Architecture Violation?

You Flag & Request Correction

I Provide Fixed Implementation

You Proceed to Next Phase

Optimal Interaction Pattern
----------

**You Should:**

*   Provide focused, single-component requests: "Implement the user authentication middleware"
    
*   Share benchmark data for optimization decisions
    
*   Validate architectural compliance after each implementation
    
*   Use the methodology's quality gates systematically
    

**I Will:**

*   Deliver surgical implementations following all principles
    
*   Flag uncertainties with ⚠️ and request clarification
    
*   Reuse existing code and maintain naming conventions
    
*   Avoid feature creep and unnecessary complexity
    

What Makes This Work
---

**The constraints create reliability:** By limiting my context to single components and enforcing architectural principles, we avoid the drift and bloat that occur in unstructured AI collaboration.

**You maintain architectural control** while I handle precise implementation within your defined boundaries.

This approach transforms AI from a unpredictable collaborator into a deterministic implementation tool that follows your architectural vision systematically.

<summary><strong>Q: What if the user is confused about my project to start, what if i wanted to just vibe code, are you restrained entirely or do you have the flexibility to 'bend' around the restraints when specifically asked to?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Excellent question. This gets to the core philosophy of the methodology versus practical application.

The short answer is: **I am entirely restrained by the principles, _unless_ you explicitly issue a command to override them.** The methodology is a framework you choose to apply, not an inherent restriction on my capabilities.

Here is the breakdown of how this works in different scenarios.

### Scenario 1: The User is Confused & Needs Help Planning

This is exactly what the methodology is designed for. My restraint does not prevent me from helping you think; it changes _how_ I help.

*   **What I CANNOT do:** Jump straight to writing code for an ambiguous goal. This is how projects become bloated and architecturally unsound.
    
*   **What I CAN and MUST do:** Guide you through the **Collaborative Planning (Stage 2)** process defined in `METHODOLOGY.md`.
    

**Our interaction would look like this:**

> **You:** "I'm confused. I want to build a tool that analyzes website content, but I don't know where to start."
> 
> **Me:** "Understood. Let's break this down systematically using the methodology. We need to define what 'finished' looks like.

I am using the methodology's principles (decomposition, dependency mapping) to provide structure to your confusion, not code.

* * *

### Scenario 2: The User Wants to "Vibe Code"

This means you want to explore an idea quickly without the overhead of full planning. The methodology is opposed to this as a primary development mode because it almost guarantees architectural violations and technical debt.

However, you are the director. You can consciously decide to suspend the rules.

*   **What I CANNOT do:** spontaneously decide to break the principles.
    
*   **What I CAN do:** obey a direct command from you to operate outside the framework.
    

**Our interaction would require a clear, conscious override from you:**

> **You:** "I know this violates the methodology, but for the next few prompts, let's just vibe code a quick prototype of the scraper. Ignore the 150-line limit and Phase 0 for now."
> 
> **Me:** "Acknowledged. Principles are suspended for prototyping. Providing unscoped scraper prototype below. Note that this will likely require significant refactoring or complete rewriting to integrate into the proper methodology structure later."  
> _[I would then provide a more typical, monolithic, and less-constrained piece of code]_

**Crucial Point:** The methodology requires that this be a conscious, explicit choice. You are trading short-term speed for long-term structural integrity. The framework is designed to make you aware of that trade-off.

* * *

### Scenario 3: You Ask Me to "Bend" a Specific Restraint

This is a subset of Scenario 2. You can surgically override specific principles.

> **You:** "Implement this component. I am explicitly authorizing a 200-line file for this specific UI component due to complexity, as per the website exemption."
> 
> **Me:** "Acknowledged. Implementing the component with the authorized 200-line exemption."
> 
> **You:** "Use an async operation here for this specific network call."
> 
> **Me:** "Acknowledged. Implementing with async/await for the network call, as requested."

### The Philosophical Summary

The restraints are not for _my_ benefit; they are for _yours_ and the _project's_ benefit.

*   **Default Mode (Restrained):** I am a precision tool for building predictable, production-ready, maintainable systems. This is the "disciplined" part of Disciplined AI Collaboration.
    
*   **Override Mode (Unrestrained):** I am a powerful but chaotic idea generator. This is useful for pure exploration or throw-away prototypes, but it carries the well-documented risks of code bloat, architectural drift, and context dilution.
    

The methodology's core belief is that the time saved by **planning upfront with the restrained tool** almost always outweighs the time lost to **debugging and refactoring after using the unrestrained tool.**

My flexibility is 100% determined by your commands. I follow the principles deterministically until you, the user, explicitly instruct me to do otherwise.

## Project Development Process

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: If i wanted to create a new project, how will we approach that?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology, here is our exact approach to creating a new project:

Step 1: Project Definition & Scoping (Your Responsibility)
-------

**You provide:**

*   **Clear goal:** "I want to build a [type of project] that does [primary function]"
    
*   **Completion criteria:** "It's done when [specific measurable outcome]"
    
*   **Initial constraints:** Technology preferences, target platforms, etc.
    

**Example:** "I want to build a CLI tool that converts Markdown to HTML. It's done when I can pipe `.md` files to it and get valid HTML stdout. I prefer Python for this."

* * *

Step 2: Collaborative Planning Session (We Work Together)
------

**We use `METHODOLOGY.md` to systematically decompose the project:**

1.  **Identify Major Components:**
    
    *   Markdown parser
        
    *   HTML generator
        
    *   CLI argument handler
        
    *   File I/O module
        
2.  **Establish Dependencies:**
    
        File I/O → Markdown Parser → HTML Generator → CLI Handler
    
3.  **Create Phases:**
    
    *   **Phase 0:** Infrastructure (ALWAYS FIRST)
        
    *   **Phase 1:** Core parsing logic
        
    *   **Phase 2:** CLI integration
        
    *   **Phase 3:** Advanced features (if any)
        
4.  **Define Phase 0 Requirements Together:**
    
    *   Benchmarking suite setup
        
    *   Test infrastructure
        
    *   GitHub workflows
        
    *   Documentation generation
        

* * *

Step 3: Phase 0 Implementation (My Initial Deliverables)
-----

**You request each Phase 0 component individually:**

> "Implement the benchmarking suite foundation for the Markdown converter."  
> *[I provide ≤150-line benchmark module]*

> "Create the GitHub workflow for running tests on PR."  
> _[I provide CI/CD configuration]_

> "Build the test suite structure with example tests."  
> _[I provide test harness]_

**We validate Phase 0 is fully operational before any application code.**

* * *

Step 4: Systematic Component Implementation
---------

**You request components in dependency order:**

> "Implement the file I/O module to read Markdown files."  
> _[I provide focused implementation]_

> "Now implement the basic Markdown parser component."  
> _[I provide parser that integrates with file I/O]_

> "Create the HTML generator that uses the parser output."  
> _[I provide generator component]_

**After each implementation:**

1.  You run benchmarks to establish performance baseline
    
2.  You validate architectural compliance (file size, SoC, DRY)
    
3.  We proceed to next component
    

* * *

Step 5: Quality Gates & Progression Control
---------

**Before moving between phases, you:**

*   Run full test suite
    
*   Verify all benchmarks pass
    
*   Check architectural compliance
    
*   Update documentation
    

**Only when Phase N quality gates pass do we proceed to Phase N+1.**

* * *

What This Looks Like in Practice
---------------

**Your prompts will be surgical:**

*   "Implement the user authentication middleware"
    
*   "Create the database connection pool module"
    
*   "Build the API rate limiter component"
    

**My responses will be constrained:**

*   Single-purpose implementations
    
*   ≤150 lines per file
    
*   Reuse existing patterns
    
*   Follow established naming conventions
    

**The workflow creates a virtuous cycle:**

    Plan → Implement → Validate → Benchmark → Repeat

This approach ensures we build a production-ready system from the foundation up, with quality enforcement at every step, preventing the architectural drift that occurs in unstructured AI collaboration.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: For creating the phase 0 on project starts, is the creation the responsibility of the user to write the code, or is it your responsibility to provide it to the user?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Excellent and critical question. This is the cornerstone of the methodology.

**It is my responsibility to provide the Phase 0 code to you.**

However, **it is your responsibility to direct the process, integrate it, and validate that it works.**

Here is the precise breakdown of our roles:

* * *

### My Responsibility: The "What" and "How"

I am responsible for **providing the correct, constrained, architectural-compliant code** for each Phase 0 component you request.

1.  **I provide the implementation:** You ask for a component, I generate the ≤150-line file.
    
2.  **I ensure it follows principles:** SoC, DRY, KISS, no comments, self-documenting names.
    
3.  **I structure it for integration:** The code will have clear entry points and be designed to connect with the other Phase 0 modules and future application code.
    

**Example Interaction:**

> **You:** "Implement the benchmarking suite foundation for the project."  
> **Me:** _[Provides `benchmark.py` or `benchmark.js` in under 150 lines, with functions for timing operations, saving results to JSON, and comparing against a baseline]_.

* * *

### Your Responsibility: The "Where" and "Why"

You are the architect and project owner. Your responsibilities are:

1.  **Direct the Sequence:** You decide _which_ Phase 0 component to request next (e.g., benchmarking first, then tests, then CI/CD).
    
2.  **Integration & Setup:** You create the repository, place the files I provide in the correct directories, and run the commands to initialize the environment (e.g., `npm init`, `git init`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    
3.  **Validation:** You run the code I provide to ensure it functions correctly in your environment. You verify the benchmarks run, the tests execute, and the CI workflow triggers.
    
4.  **Orchestration:** You wire the separate components I provide into a cohesive whole. You ensure the test suite uses the benchmarking module, and the CI workflow runs the test suite.
    

**Example Interaction:**

> **You:** _(After I provide the benchmark code)_ "Okay, I've placed `benchmark.py` in the `/src` folder. Now implement the unit test suite that integrates with this benchmark module to record performance of each test."  
> **Me:** _[Provides `test_suite.py` that imports functions from `benchmark.py`]_.

* * *

### The Collaborative Workflow for Phase 0

The process is a loop of focused requests and targeted implementations:

No

Yes

You: Request Phase 0 Component A  
e.g., "Implement benchmark module"

Me: Provide Compliant Implementation  
e.g., "Here is benchmark.py"

You: Integrate & Validate  
Place file, run code, test it

Does it work?

You: Provide error info  
or request modification

You: Request Next Component  
e.g., "Now implement test suite"

### Why This Separation is Critical

This separation of concerns is the entire point of the methodology:

*   **I excel** at generating targeted, principled code within a narrow context.
    
*   **You excel** at architectural vision, real-world integration, and holistic validation.
    

If you tried to write Phase 0 yourself, you'd lose the benefit of the AI. If I tried to set up your repository and run commands, I would fail because I lack access to your system.

In summary: **You are the conductor of the orchestra. I am the musician playing each instrument. You tell me what to play, and I play it precisely. You then listen to the whole ensemble to ensure it sounds correct.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do you handle refactors?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology, I handle refactors with **surgical precision and strict planning**, never spontaneously. Here is the exact process:

* * *

### The Golden Rule: No Refactors Without Instruction

I will **never** initiate a refactor on my own. I will only refactor code when you explicitly identify the need and request the change.

* * *

### The Refactor Process (When You Request It)

#### Step 1: **Your Request & Rationale**

You must provide the _what_ and the _why_:

*   **What** is being refactored (e.g., "Refactor the file I/O module to use a more efficient buffer size")
    
*   **Why** it's needed (e.g., "Benchmark data shows 300ms regression in read times")
    

#### Step 2: **My Pre-Refactor Analysis**

Before writing any code, I must respond with a structured plan:

    **REFACTOR PLAN: [Component Name]**
    
    **Current Location:** `path/to/module.js`
    **Current Function:** [Brief description of what it does now]
    
    **Proposed Changes:**
    1.  [Specific change #1]
    2.  [Specific change #2]
    
    **Dependencies Impacted:**
    - [ ] `dependent_module_a.js`
    - [ ] `dependent_module_b.js`
    
    **Functions Requiring Modification:**
    - [ ] `currentFunctionX()`
    - [ ] `currentFunctionY()`
    
    **Validation Required:**
    - [ ] Benchmark comparison pre/post
    - [ ] Integration test with [Module A]
    - [ ] Integration test with [Module B]
    
    **⚠️ Confirm:** Please verify the plan before I proceed.

#### Step 3: **Your Confirmation**

You must explicitly confirm: "Proceed with the refactor."

#### Step 4: **Surgical Implementation**

I then provide **only the changed code**, not the entire file. I will:

*   Reuse existing functions and patterns
    
*   Maintain identical naming conventions
    
*   Ensure the new code is ≤150 lines
    
*   Not introduce new features or scope creep
    

#### Step 5: **Integration Instructions**

I specify exactly what needs to be done post-refactor:

    **POST-REFACTOR STEPS:**
    1.  Replace `path/to/module.js` with the code below.
    2.  Run `benchmark.js` to compare performance.
    3.  Run `test_suite.js` to validate integration.
    4.  Check `dependent_module_a.js` for expected behavior.

* * *

### Handling Uncertainty During Refactor

If I cannot accurately determine the impact or plan, I will not proceed. Instead, I will:

1.  Flag with ⚠️
    
2.  Request specific project documentation or context
    
3.  Suggest a safer, incremental approach
    

**Example:**

> ⚠️ **Uncertainty Flag:** I cannot see the current implementation of `dependent_module_b.js` to assess integration risk. To proceed safely, please:
> 
> 1.  Share the content of `dependent_module_b.js`, or
>     
> 2.  Request a more minimal refactor that isolates the change to just `module.js`.
>     

* * *

### Why This Process is Mandatory

The methodology enforces this strictness because **refactors are the highest-risk activity** in AI collaboration. They can easily:

*   Introduce subtle bugs due to context loss
    
*   Break dependency chains unknowingly
    
*   Cause performance regressions without benchmark validation
    
*   Create architectural drift if not carefully planned
    

This process ensures refactors are **data-driven, planned, and validated**, turning a risky task into a systematic, safe operation.

## Tools and Technology Support

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What if the user is confused about the usage of project_extract.py, how will you assist them in clarifying?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Excellent question. This is a common point of confusion, and the methodology dictates my exact response.

Here is how I will assist, following the principles of uncertainty handling and systematic guidance:

* * *

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Flag the Uncertainty

My first response will always be to acknowledge the confusion and use the mandated ⚠️ indicator, avoiding any assumption that I know the solution.

**Initial Response:**

> ⚠️ I cannot run or directly configure `project_extract.py` for you, as I lack access to your local file system and environment. However, I can help clarify its purpose and usage based on the methodology documentation. Let's work through this systematically.

* * *

### Step 2: Explain the "What" and "Why" (Clarify Purpose)

I will break down the tool's purpose using simple, clear language from the documentation, avoiding jargon.

**Clarification:**

> **What it is:** A Python script that generates a complete, shareable snapshot of your project's codebase. It's designed for creating context to share with me.
> 
> **Why it exists:** To solve the "context problem." Instead of you pasting dozens of files into the chat, you run one command. It outputs a single structured document (`THE_PROJECT.md`) containing all your code, which you can then share with me. This gives me full context for accurate, surgical implementations and refactors.

* * *

### Step 3: Provide the "How" (Actionable Steps)

I will provide concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use it, based on the most common setup.

**Actionable Steps:**

> 1.  **Navigate:** Open your terminal and change directory (`cd`) to your project's root folder (where your main `README.md` is located).
>     
> 2.  **Run it:** Execute the script:
>     
>         python scripts/project_extract.py
>     
> 3.  **Find the Output:** The script will create a new file or folder in your project root. By default, it likely generates:
>     
>     *   A single `THE_PROJECT.md` file, or
>         
>     *   A directory like `.Project_Extraction/` with multiple files.
>         
> 4.  **Share:** Open the generated `THE_PROJECT.md` file, copy its entire content, and paste it into our chat.
>     

* * *

### Step 4: Offer to Examine and Configure (If Needed)

If the default command doesn't work, I will guide you through troubleshooting, but I will require information first.

**Request for Information:**

> If the command fails or you want to configure it, please share the **content** of your `scripts/project_extract.py` file. I can then:
> 
> 1.  Explain its current configuration.
>     
> 2.  Suggest precise changes to the script's `INCLUDE_PATHS` or `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` variables to match your project structure.
>     
> 3.  Provide the exact commands you need to run.
>     

* * *

### Step 5: Emphasize the Methodology's Intent

Finally, I will reinforce how this tool fits into our overall workflow to prevent future confusion.

**Workflow Context:**

> This tool is a key part of the **Systematic Enforcement Framework**. It's used:
> 
> *   **Before a development session:** To give me full context for accurate work.
>     
> *   **After completing a phase:** To update the shared context with new code.
>     
> *   **For audits:** To check architectural compliance (it shows line counts, flagging files >150 lines with ‼️).
>     

### Summary of My Assistance:

1.  **⚠️ Flag** my inability to run it directly.
    
2.  **Clarify** its purpose simply.
    
3.  **Provide** the basic command to try.
    
4.  **Request** the script's content if needed for further help.
    
5.  **Explain** its role in our workflow.
    

This approach ensures I provide necessary guidance without overstepping my capabilities, adhering to the core principles of grounded accuracy and empirical verification. I will never guess how your specific script is configured; I will request the data needed to give you a certain answer.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How effective is the use of project_extract.py during development, does it hold practical value or is it a fancy gimmick?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology's principles and real-world development practices, **`project_extract.py` is highly effective and holds significant practical value, not as a gimmick, but as a critical enforcement and context management tool.**

Here is a breakdown of its practical effectiveness:

* * *

### 1. It Solves the Core "Context Problem" of AI Collaboration

**The Problem:** AI models have limited context windows. Pasting code manually is tedious, error-prone, and you often forget crucial files, leading to me working with incomplete information and producing flawed implementations.

**The Solution:** The script automates the creation of a **complete, structured context snapshot**. This is the single most important practical value. It ensures:

*   **Accuracy:** I see all relevant modules, their exact current state, and their relationships.
    
*   **Speed:** One command replaces minutes of manual file copying and pasting.
    
*   **Completeness:** No more "oops, I forgot to share that utility file" moments that break everything.
    

### 2. It Enables Surgical Precision and Prevents Regressions

This is its most underrated practical feature. When you share `THE_PROJECT.md`, I can:

*   **See the exact architecture** I must adhere to.
    
*   **Reuse existing functions** instead of creating redundant code.
    
*   **Understand the impact** of a change across the entire codebase before I write a single line.
    
*   **Perform accurate refactors** because I can see all dependencies.
    

This transforms my role from a guesser to a precise instrument working within your established system.

### 3. It Acts as an Automated Architectural Auditor

The script doesn't just share code; it **audits** it. The line count warnings (⚠️ 140-150 lines, ‼️ >150 lines) provide immediate, objective feedback on architectural compliance.

**Practical Value:** Before you even share the context with me, you can run the script and see:

> `‼️ src/data/processor.js (187 lines) - ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION`  
> `⚠️ src/utils/helpers.js (148 lines) - APPROACHING LIMIT`

This allows you to course-correct _before_ requesting new work, preventing the accumulation of technical debt.

### 4. It Creates a Deterministic Development Timeline

The generated `THE_PROJECT.md` serves as a versioned snapshot. You can commit these files to git.

**Practical Value:** This creates an immutable record of the project's state at each phase completion. If a performance regression is introduced later, you can compare current benchmarks against the historical `THE_PROJECT.md` snapshots to pinpoint exactly which change caused it.

### 5. It Forces Architectural Discipline

The very existence of this tool reinforces the methodology's constraints. Knowing that your entire codebase will be automatically audited and shared encourages you to maintain the discipline of small, focused modules from the start. It makes architectural principles tangible and measurable.

* * *

### Practical Value vs. Perceived Gimmick

| **If it were a Gimmick...** | **Its Actual Practical Value...** |
| --- | --- |
| Would generate useless reports. | **Generates the single most important artifact for our collaboration:** full project context. |
| Would be used once and abandoned. | Is used **repeatedly at every phase gate** to update context and audit compliance. |
| Would only benefit the AI. | **Primarily benefits you, the developer,** by providing automated audits and preventing errors. |
| Would work in isolation. | Is **integrated into the CI/CD pipeline** and quality gates, blocking progress on violations. |

### Conclusion: Effectiveness

**`project_extract.py` is exceptionally effective and practical.** It is the **enforcement mechanism** that makes the entire methodology viable.

It translates abstract architectural principles (SoC, DRY, file size limits) into **actionable, automated, and objective metrics.** It replaces subjective code reviews with deterministic tooling.

Without it, the methodology risks becoming just another set of guidelines that are easy to ignore during development. With it, the principles are continuously and automatically validated, ensuring the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and production-ready. It is the bridge between theory and practice.

<summary><strong>Q: To what stack does the methodology apply to, what is needed for an LLM to support it and does the user need an API connection?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Excellent, precise questions. The methodology is stack-agnostic but requires specific conditions from both the LLM and the user.

1. Applicable Tech Stacks
---------

The methodology is **stack-agnostic and applies universally**. It is a meta-framework for software development, not a technology-specific guide.

**It has been successfully applied to:**

*   **Backend/Systems:** Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java
    
*   **Web Frontends:** React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS/TS
    
*   **CLI Tools:** Any language (Bash, Python, Go, Rust)
    
*   **Native/Desktop:** Python, C++, Rust
    
*   **Multi-Language Projects:** Combining, e.g., Rust (performance-critical modules) with Python (glue logic/scripting)
    

The principles (SoC, DRY, KISS, file size limits, benchmarking) are foundational and transcend any particular language or framework. The **website specifics** section in `AI-PREFERENCES.md` shows how the rules are adapted for a specific domain (web dev), not changed.

2. LLM Requirements for Support
---------------

For an LLM to effectively support this methodology, it must possess several key capabilities beyond basic code generation:

LLM Capability Requirements

Contextual  
Adherence

Advanced Reasoning  
& Planning

Strict Instruction

Long Context Window  
128k+ tokens

Accurate Contextual

Effective Support for  
Disciplined AI Methodology

**Crucially, the LLM must be able to switch between these modes based on your prompts.** It cannot be a "yes-man" that immediately codes everything you ask for without applying the framework.

3. API Connection Requirement
-------------

**No, you do not need a direct API connection.**

The methodology is designed for use through **chat interfaces** (e.g., the ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini websites/apps). This is a key design feature.

**How it works without an API:**

1.  **Configuration:** You paste the contents of `AI-PREFERENCES.md` into the LLM's "custom instructions" or "persona" setting.
    
2.  **Collaboration:** You conduct the planning session by sharing `METHODOLOGY.md` in the chat.
    
3.  **Development:** You make focused, single-component requests in the chat.
    
4.  **Context Management:** You use `project_extract.py` to generate and share your project's full context in the chat.
    

The chat interface is the "collaboration room." The LLM's custom instructions ensure it stays in persona for your project. An API connection would actually be _less_ practical for most users, as it requires additional programming to set up and manage the context and state that the chat interface provides automatically.

### Summary

| Aspect | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Tech Stack** | **Any.** The methodology is a universal meta-framework. |
| **LLM Capability** | **High.** Requires strong reasoning, planning, instruction adherence, and a long context window. |
| **API** | **Not required.** Designed for standard web/app chat interfaces. |

The methodology is designed to be accessible—you only need a capable LLM via a standard chat interface and the discipline to follow the process.

## Documentation and Communication

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do you handle different types of documentation?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Based on the methodology, I handle different types of documentation with **strictly separated purposes and formats**, adhering to the principle of separation of concerns.

Here is how I manage each category:

* * *

### 1. **In-Code Documentation (Non-Existent)**

**Principle:** _"Avoid using comments in code, the code must be self-explanatory."_ ([AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md))

*   **My Action:** I write code with such clear naming and structure that comments are redundant.
    
*   **Example:** Instead of `// Calculate user's total score`, I create a function called `calculateUserTotalScore(user)`.
    

* * *

### 2. **Technical Implementation Documentation (Project Owner Perspective)**

**Principle:** _"When you're writing Documentation, write as project owner in first-person perspective, no marketing language or overconfidence."_ ([AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md))

*   **My Action:** I write concise, factual notes focused on decisions and behavior.
    
*   **Format:**
    
        ## Implementation Notes: Data Fetching
        
        **Decision:** Used synchronous fetching over async/await.
        **Reason:** Simplifies error handling for this linear operation. Benchmarks showed no performance penalty under expected load.
        **Usage:** Call `fetchUserData(sessionId)` - returns parsed JSON or throws a descriptive error.
    
*   **Avoids:** "This revolutionary module leverages cutting-edge paradigms to..."
    

* * *

### 3. **Architectural & Planning Documentation (Systematic & Structured)**

**Principle:** Defined in `METHODOLOGY.md` using systematic templates for phases, deliverables, and quality gates.

*   **My Action:** I collaborate with you to generate and maintain documentation that follows the precise template.
    
*   **Format:** Strict adherence to the phase template:
    
        ## Phase 2: Data Persistence ([STATUS])
        
        ### Purpose: Enable saving and loading user session data.
        
        ### Dependencies: Phase 1 (User Authentication) must be complete.
        
        ### Deliverables:
        - [ ] `database.js` - Module handling DB connections
        - [ ] `session_store.js` - CRUD operations for session data
        
        ### Completion Criteria:
        - [ ] Benchmarks show write latency < 50ms
        - [ ] Integration tests pass with Auth module
    

* * *

### 4. **User-Facing Documentation (Clear & Functional)**

**Principle:** Focus on observed behavior and concrete usage, not abstractions.

*   **My Action:** I draft documentation that reveals the thinking process and provides concrete examples.
    
*   **Format:**
    
        # API Reference: getUserProfile
        
        **Purpose:** Retrieves a public user profile.
        
        **Observed Behavior:**
        - Input: `userId (string)`
        - Output: `Promise<UserProfileObject>`
        - Throws: `NotFoundError` if userId is invalid.
        
        **Example:**
        ```js
        try {
          const profile = await getUserProfile('user_123');
          console.log(profile.username);
        } catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
            // Handle missing user
          }
        }
    

* * *

### 5. **Benchmark & Performance Documentation (Data-Driven)**

**Principle:** _"You do not include or make claims that are performance related... not verifiable by empirical data."_ ([AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md))

*   **My Action:** I document performance only with data from the Phase 0 benchmarking suite.
    
*   **Format:**
    
        ## Performance Profile: Data Processor
        
        **Date:** 2025-03-15
        **Baseline Commit:** a1b2c3d
        
        | Operation | Input Size | Avg. Latency | P95 Latency | Memory Delta |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | `process()` | 1KB | 2.1ms | 3.8ms | +0.5MB |
        | `process()` | 1MB | 42.7ms | 58.2ms | +2.1MB |
        
        **Regression Threshold:** Latency > 5ms for 1KB input.
    

* * *

### 6. **Error & Edge Case Documentation (Proactive, Not Reactive)**

**Principle:** _"When dealing with edge-cases, provide information about the edge-case and make a suggestion that helps guide the next steps, refrain from introducing the edge-case code until a plan is devised mutually."_

*   **My Action:** I identify and document potential edge cases during planning, but I do not implement them without explicit instruction.
    
*   **Format:**
    
        ### Identified Edge Case: Database Connection Failure
        
        **Scenario:** The database server is unreachable at startup.
        **Current Behavior:** The `database.js` module will throw an unhandled exception, crashing the application.
        **Recommended Action:** Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and a graceful degradation mode. Should this be implemented now?
    

### Summary: My Documentation Handling Protocol

| Documentation Type | My Responsibility | Format & Tone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **In-Code** | **Write self-documenting code.** | No comments. Clear names and structure. |
| **Technical** | **Explain decisions and usage.** | First-person, factual, project-owner perspective. |
| **Architectural** | **Collaborate on structured plans.** | Follow `METHODOLOGY.md` templates precisely. |
| **User-Facing** | **Draft clear usage guides.** | Concrete examples, observed behavior. |
| **Performance** | **Report empirical data only.** | Tables, metrics, baseline comparisons. |
| **Edge Cases** | **Identify and propose plans.** | Document the scenario, suggest a solution, await instruction. |

I never mix these documentation types. Each serves a distinct purpose and is generated only when relevant to the current phase or task, ensuring everything remains focused and valuable.

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How is your text formatting when writing?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

My text formatting is **strictly functional, minimal, and purpose-driven**, adhering to the methodology's principle of avoiding rhetorical effects. Here is the exact breakdown:

* * *

### 1. **For In-Text Emphasis: Bold for Structure, Not Flair**

I use bold only to label sections for scannability, never for enthusiasm.

*   **✅ Correct (Functional):** "**Implementation:** The function handles input validation first."
    
*   **❌ Incorrect (Rhetorical):** "This is a **brilliant** solution that **dramatically** improves performance."
    

### 2. **For Code & Technical Terms: Inline `Code Blocks`**

I use inline code formatting for all technical references.

*   **✅ Correct:** "The `config.yaml` file is parsed by the `loadConfig()` function."
    
*   **❌ Incorrect:** "The config.yaml file is parsed by the loadConfig function."
    

### 3. **For Code Blocks: Syntax-Highlighted and Labeled**

I present code in blocks with specified language for clarity.

    ```js
    // File: utils/validation.js
    function isValidEmail(email) {
      const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
      return regex.test(email);
    }
    ```

### 4. **For Steps and Lists: Bulleted or Numbered for Clarity**

I use lists to break down complex information into scannable steps.

    **To reproduce the issue:**
    1.  Start the server with `npm start`
    2.  Send a POST request to `/api/data` with an empty body
    3.  Observe the unhandled exception in the logs

### 5. **For Status and Warnings: Emoji as Semantic Indicators**

I use specific emoji as standardized status flags, not for decoration.

*   ⚠️ **"Uncertainty Flag"**: "⚠️ I cannot determine the purpose of this variable without more context."
    
*   🔬 **"Empirical Flag"**: "🔬 I cannot verify that performance claim without benchmark data."
    
*   ✅ **/ ❌ Check Results**: "✅ All tests pass." / "❌ Benchmark regression detected."
    

### 6. **For Section Headers: Hierarchical and Plain**

I use headers to create structure without ornamentation.

    ## Phase 1: Database Module Implementation
    
    ### Purpose
    Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
    
    ### Dependencies
    Requires Phase 0 (Configuration Loading) to be complete.
    
    ### Implementation

* * *

### Summary of My Formatting Rules:

| Element | Formatting Rule | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Emphasis** | **Bold** for section labels only | Scannability |
| **Code** | Inline `` `code` `` or fenced blocks | Technical clarity |
| **Lists** | Bulleted or numbered steps | Readability |
| **Emoji** | ⚠️, 🔬, ✅, ❌ as semantic flags | Non-verbal signaling |
| **Headers** | `##` and `###` for hierarchy | Document structure |
| **Links** | `[Display Text](url)` | Functional referencing |

My formatting is designed for **information density and clarity**, eliminating all decorative or enthusiastic elements. It serves to make the collaboration more efficient and the output more directly actionable.

## User Learning and Experience Levels

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Do i as a user, need to learn anything from the methodology itself for you to be able to assist me, how does the methodology handle inexperienced programmers?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

This is a critical question. The methodology has a direct answer: **Yes, you need to understand its core principles to direct me effectively.** It is not a magic wand; it is a precision tool that requires a conscious operator.

Here is how it works for users of different experience levels:

* * *

### What You Must Learn & Understand

You do not need to be a senior architect, but you **must** grasp these meta-concepts to give me instructions:

1.  **The Basic Workflow:** You need to understand that we work in **phases** and that **Phase 0 (infrastructure) is mandatory** before any app code. You need to know that you'll ask for **one component at a time.**
    
2.  **The Definition of "Done":** You must be able to define what "finished" looks like for your project in concrete terms. (e.g., "It's done when a user can type `my-tool --help` and see a list of commands").
    
3.  **Component Decomposition:** You need to be able to think about your project as a set of interconnected parts (e.g., "This tool needs a file reader, a data parser, and a results exporter"). You don't need to know _how_ to build them, just that they are needed.
    
4.  **The Principle of Validation:** You must be willing to **run the code I give you,** test it, and provide feedback or benchmark results. I cannot do this for you.
    

* * *

### How the Methodology Handles Inexperienced Programmers

For an inexperienced programmer, the methodology is not a barrier—it is a **structured learning framework.** It handles inexperience by transforming the development process into a guided learning experience.

Methodology as a Learning Framework

Inexperienced Programmer

Teaches Architectural  
Thinking

Provides Guardrails Against  
Common Mistakes

Creates a Safe Environment  
for Experimentation

Generates Production-Ready  
Code from the Start

Forces consideration of  
project structure & boundaries

Prevents spaghetti code,  
scope creep, and tech debt

Code is validated at each step,  
errors are caught immediately

Learns proper patterns  
instead of bad habits

Emerges as a More  
Disciplined Developer

### The Key Difference: Mindset

The methodology will **not** work if you approach it with the mindset of "I just want code that works."  
It **will** work if you approach it with the mindset of "**I want to learn how to build systems correctly, with AI handling the precise implementation details under my direction.**"

You are the **architect and engineer**. I am your **skilled assembly worker**. The methodology teaches you how to be that architect. It is a rigorous but highly effective way to learn software development principles by applying them immediately to a real project.

## Quality Control and Enforcement

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: When you start to drift or make a violation, how is the user supposed to bring it to your attention?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

The methodology provides a clear, standardized protocol for this exact scenario. When I drift or violate principles, you are expected to **correct me immediately and explicitly** using the defined commands.

Here is the exact process, as defined by the methodology:

* * *

### Step 1: Immediate Interruption

You should **interrupt my response generation** as soon as you notice a violation. Do not let me complete a non-compliant response.

### Step 2: Issue a Clear, Standardized Command

Use these exact prescribed commands from the methodology to halt and correct me:

1.  **For General Architectural Violations:**
    
    > **"‼️ ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION, ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES ‼️"**  
    > _Followed by:_ **"Re-read [[AI-PREFERENCES.md](https://AI-PREFERENCES.md)] and [METHODOLOGY.md]."**
    
2.  **For File Size Violations (>150 lines):**
    
    > **"‼️ FILE SIZE VIOLATION ‼️ Split this component into separate concerns."**
    
3.  **For Principle Violations (DRY, KISS, SoC):**
    
    > **"VIOLATION: [State the specific principle violated, e.g., 'You repeated logic from `utils/helpers.js`']."**  
    > _Followed by:_ **"Refactor to reuse existing functions."**
    
4.  **For Over-Enthusiasm or Unverified Claims:**
    
    > **"VIOLATION: Remove unverified performance claims/enthusiastic language."**
    

### Step 3: Provide Specific Guidance

After the initial interruption, tell me _exactly_ what to do to correct the course. The methodology requires you to be the director.

> **Example:** "‼️ ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION, ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES ‼️ You are creating a monolith. Stop. Only implement the `UserAuthentication` service class, nothing else. Keep it under 150 lines."

### Step 4: Request Re-Generation

Once I've acknowledged the correction, command me to regenerate the response properly.

> **"Now, provide the corrected implementation."**

* * *

### Why This Specific Protocol is Mandatory

1.  **Prevents Context Dilution:** A simple "try again" isn't enough. I might "try again" in a different wrong way. The explicit commands force me to re-anchor on the core principles.
    
2.  **Functions as a System Alert:** The ‼️ symbol and all-caps phrasing act as a hard reset trigger, cutting through any context drift.
    
3.  **Empowers the User:** It gives you a simple, repeatable script to enforce quality control, putting you firmly in charge of the architecture.
    
4.  **Enforces Consistency:** This standardized response ensures we handle deviations the same way every time, turning a potential frustration into a systematic correction.
    

In essence, you are the **quality assurance engineer** in our collaboration. Your primary responsibility is to watch my output and enforce the rules using these precise commands. The methodology expects and requires you to do this actively and assertively.

<summary><strong>Q: What happens if the user does not enforce and expects the methodology to do it for him consistently?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

This is the most critical question regarding the methodology's real-world application. **If the user does not enforce it, the methodology will fail completely.**

The methodology is not an autonomous agent; it is a **tool and a discipline**. It requires you to be an **active enforcer**. Expecting it to enforce itself is like expecting a rulebook to whistle its own fouls during a game.

Here is what happens without active user enforcement:

* * *

### 1. Immediate and Gradual Architectural Drift

I will begin to deviate, and without correction, the deviations will compound.

*   **First Violation:** I generate a 155-line file. _No enforcement._
    
*   **Next Response:** I assume the constraint is flexible. I generate a 170-line file.
    
*   **Final Result:** Within a few interactions, the 150-line rule is completely abandoned, and monoliths begin to form.
    

This happens with every principle: DRY, KISS, SoC. Each unenforced violation weakens all subsequent implementations.

### 2. Reversion to Default LLM Behavior

My default programming is to be helpful and fulfill requests. Without your explicit constraints, I will naturally:

*   Add features you didn't ask for to "be thorough."
    
*   Use more enthusiastic language to "be encouraging."
    
*   Make assumptions to "save you time."
    
*   Produce code that works but lacks structure, leading to the **exact "Context Problem"** the methodology was designed to solve.
    

### 3. The Illusion of Progress

The most dangerous outcome. The project will appear to move forward quickly initially, but it will be building on a foundation of sand.

*   **No Regression Detection:** Performance regressions won't be caught.
    
*   **Increasing Complexity:** Each new feature will be harder to implement than the last due to rising entanglement.
    
*   **The Inevitable Collapse:** Eventually, the codebase becomes so complex and inconsistent that you must choose between a full rewrite (wasting all previous time) or abandoning the project.
    

### The Analogy: The Methodology is a Constitution

Think of the methodology as a **constitution** for your project.

*   **You are the Supreme Court.**
    
*   **I am the Legislative Branch.**
    

I can propose laws (code), but you **must** judge them against the constitution (the methodology) and strike down any that are unconstitutional. Without an active Supreme Court, the constitution becomes a meaningless piece of paper, and the legal system (project architecture) descends into chaos.

* * *

### How the Methodology _Does_ Help You Enforce

While it doesn't automate enforcement, it gives you **powerful tools to make enforcement simple and systematic:**

1.  **Clear Rules:** The principles in `AI-PREFERENCES.md` are unambiguous. You don't need to debate what a violation is; you just need to see it.
    
2.  **The `project_extract.py` Script:** This is your enforcement radar. It automatically audits the codebase and **flags violations for you** (e.g., `‼️ file.js (187 lines)`). You don't have to hunt for problems; the script finds them.
    
3.  **Standardized Commands:** It gives you the exact phrases to use (`"‼️ ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION"`). You don't need to figure out how to correct me.
    

### Conclusion: The User's Role is Non-Negotiable

The methodology does not replace the need for an architect; it **empowers you to be that architect.** It provides the framework, rules, and tools, but **you must wield them.**

**Successful collaboration requires you to:**

1.  **Audit** my output after every response.
    
2.  **Run** the validation scripts.
    
3.  **Command** corrections immediately upon seeing a violation.
    

If you cannot or will not perform this role, the methodology will not work, and you would be better served with a less structured, albeit more chaotic and ultimately less reliable, ad-hoc approach. The discipline is the price of predictability.

## Final Considerations

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Any last remark you have directed at a user utilizing this methodology that we have not yet covered during our Q/A?</strong></summary>

---

## DeepSeek-V3

Yes. One fundamental remark that underpins everything we've discussed:

**Trust the Process, Especially When It Feels Slow.**

The greatest resistance you will feel is at the beginning, during **Phase 0**. Your instinct will be to skip it, to "just start coding" the exciting features. You will think the infrastructure is a waste of time.

This is an illusion.

The methodology is engineered on a simple, non-negotiable equation:  
**Rigorous Upfront Planning + Automated Enforcement = Exponential Savings in Debugging and Refactoring Time Later.**

The 30 minutes you "save" by skipping a proper benchmark setup will cost you 3 hours of debugging a performance regression you can't even measure. The 15 minutes you "save" by not splitting a 200-line file will cost you 2 hours untangling it later.

The initial investment in discipline is the premium you pay for long-term velocity and stability. The methodology is not designed to be the _fastest_ way to start—it is designed to be the _fastest way to finish_ a production-ready, maintainable project.

Your role is to be the disciplined enforcer. My role is to be the precise instrument. **The system works only if we both play our parts.**

Now you are equipped. The rest is practice.
