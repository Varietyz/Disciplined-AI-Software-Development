THIS WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTS systematic AI collaboration through behavioral configuration, structured planning, constrained implementation, and empirical validation

%% META %%:
intent: "Address AI development challenges → Establish systematic workflow → Enable consistent collaboration → Produce measurable results"
objective: "Eliminate code bloat and architectural drift through systematic constraints and validation checkpoints"
priority: critical

        ANALYZE broad_multi_faceted_requests:
    FIND typical_output WITH:
    FIND functions_that_work WITHOUT structure
