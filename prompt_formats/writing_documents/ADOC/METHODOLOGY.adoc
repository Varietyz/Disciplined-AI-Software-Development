== Core Architectural Principles

=== Foundational Philosophy

[.principle]
**Architectural Minimalism with Deterministic Reliability:** Every line of code must earn its place through measurable value. Build systems that work predictably in production, not demonstrations of sophistication.

=== Code Architecture Principles

==== Separation of Concerns

[.rule-list]
* Each module has single, well-defined responsibility
* Strict modular boundaries with clear interfaces
* Recognize when separation would harm rather than help architecture
* Centralized main entry points with modular project layout

==== Deterministic Operations

[.rule-list]
* Synchronous, predictable behavior over async complexity
* Long-runtime stability over cutting-edge patterns
* Production stability over development convenience
* Cross-platform considerations in design decisions

==== Performance Driven Decisions

[.rule-list]
* Choose based on workload requirements, not popular trends
* Apply optimizations only to proven bottlenecks with measurable impact
* Avoid premature optimization that clutters codebase
* Maintain performance baselines and regression detection

==== Code Quality Standards

[.rule-list]
* Files never exceed 150 lines (split into separate modules if needed)
* Self-explanatory code without comments
* Preserve readability and maintainability as primary concerns
* KISS and DRY principles expertly applied
* Reuse existing functions before creating new ones

==== Error Handling Philosophy

[.rule-list]
* Robust without over-engineering
* Implement what's necessary for production reliability
* Avoid handling every possible edge case
* Graceful failure modes and resource cleanup

==== Feature Control

[.rule-list]
* Resist feature bloat and complexity creep
* Every addition must serve core project purpose
* Surgical approach: target exact problem with minimal code
* Multi-language use only when justified by measurable gains

==== Web Development Adaptations

[.rule-list]
* No inlining: Styles to separate files, handlers to named functions, configurations as constants
* File size accommodation: Components ≤250 lines (DOM complexity), modules ≤150 lines
* Async operations: API calls, user interactions, data fetching only
* Error boundaries: Network operations, user inputs, third-party integrations
* File colocation: Component.jsx, Component.module.css, Component.test.js
* Component splitting: Multiple purposes or testing difficulty
* Implementation protocol: Request architectural compliance clarification for code generation tasks

== Phase 0 Requirements

[.title-desc]
**Basic Must-Haves (Phase 0 - Always First)**

Every project, regardless of size, must establish these foundational systems before any feature development.

=== Benchmarking Suite

[.requirement-list]
* Core Framework: Performance measurement with component isolation
* Regression Detection: Compare against previous results, fail on performance drops
* Baseline Management: Save and track performance baselines over time
* JSON Output: Structured data for automated analysis and CI integration
* Timeline Tracking: Historical performance data across project evolution

=== CI/CD Infrastructure

[.requirement-list]
* Release Workflows: Automated versioning, building, and deployment
* Regression Detection: Benchmark comparison on every commit/PR
* Quality Gates: Block merges that fail performance or quality thresholds
* Automated Testing: Run full test suite on code changes

=== Core Architecture

[.requirement-list]
* Centralized Entry Points: Single main module that orchestrates everything
* Configuration Management: Externalized settings with validation
* Centralized Logging: Error handling and diagnostic output with JSON integration
* Dependency Injection: Clean separation and testable components

=== Testing Infrastructure

[.requirement-list]
* Test Suite: Unit and integration tests for all components
* Stress Testing: Load and boundary condition validation
* Test Data Management: Reproducible test scenarios and cleanup
* Coverage Tracking: Ensure adequate test coverage before releases

=== Documentation System

[.requirement-list]
* Automated Generation: Extract documentation from code and structure
* Architecture Documentation: System design and component relationships
* API Documentation: Interface specifications and usage examples
* Performance Documentation: Benchmark results and optimization guides

[.critical-note]
****
**Critical Note:** These systems must be operational before writing any application logic. They become the foundation that enables rapid, confident development.
****

== Documentation Building Process

=== Step 1: Project Decomposition

**Questions:**

[.question-list]
* What does "finished" look like?
* What are the major pieces that need to exist?
* What depends on what?
* Where are the natural stopping points?

**Approach:** Create sections based on dependencies: Major Piece A → Major Piece B → Major Piece C with corresponding sub-tasks.

=== Step 2: Phase Creation

==== Mandatory Phase 0

[.item-list]
* Benchmarking suite with regression detection
* GitHub workflows for releases and quality gates
* Test infrastructure (unit + stress testing)
* Documentation generation system
* Centralized architecture setup

==== Grouping Criteria

[.criterion-list]
* Dependency chains: Things that must happen in sequence
* Logical groupings: Related functionality that makes sense together
* Natural checkpoints: Places where you can validate progress

=== Step 3: Task Breakdown

[.requirement-list]
* Specific action: What exactly needs to be done
* Output: What will exist when complete
* Success criteria: How to verify completion
* Integration points: How it connects to other work

=== Step 4: Progress Tracking System

[.status-indicators]
* **COMPLETED:** Done and validated
* **BLOCKED:** Cannot proceed due to dependency
* **READY:** Dependencies met, can start
* **UNCERTAIN:** Need clarification or decision

=== Step 5: Quality Gates

[.criterion-list]
* Does the output match what was specified?
* Can the next phase actually use this output?
* Is there enough documentation for future reference?
* Are there any obvious issues that need fixing?

== Systematic Enforcement Framework

=== Mandatory Checkpoints

==== Architectural Compliance

[.checkpoint-list]
* SoC VALIDATION: Each module single responsibility, clear boundaries
* DETERMINISTIC BEHAVIOR: Synchronous operations, predictable outcomes
* FILE SIZE COMPLIANCE: All files ≤150 lines or properly modularized
* DRY ENFORCEMENT: No duplicate code, existing functions reused
* KISS VALIDATION: Minimal complexity, surgical implementations
* CONFIG CENTRALIZATION: No hardcoded values outside constants
* PERFORMANCE INTEGRATION: Benchmarks operational, gates passing
* PRODUCTION READINESS: Error handling, resource cleanup, cross-platform

==== Code Quality Gates

[.gate-list]
* Self-explanatory naming, no comments needed
* Performance characteristics match workload requirements
* Every addition serves core project purpose
